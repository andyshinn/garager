# Garager

Garager is a cloud connected relay and set of limit sensors for controlling an automatic garage door. It is built using:

* Particle Photon
* Particle Relay Shield
* Two limit switches
* A 3D printed case

The code here is the initial working prototype for controlling the relays using the Particle Cloud.
